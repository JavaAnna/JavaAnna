My name is Anna and I am excited to learn all things Javascript, CSS, and HTML, (basically front end development) and I can't wait to collaborate on projects that focus on Open Source Intelligence programs. :D 

You may have stumbled upon my GitHub page through my Discord, as that's where you can often find me hanging out. However if you don't have me added I am not available for direct contact :(

Fun fact about me: I absolutely adore cats and spending hours coding away on my computer 🐱💻
