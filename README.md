My name is Anna, I'm studying at the moment to become a Pentester. 

I am active on Hack The Box and TryHackMe, as well as researching OSINT and learning Digital Forensics as a hobby. 

I plan to write several articles in the future on Medium and my LinkedIn about everything I learn. 

I will list my links here at a later time :) 

I love cats, writing stories, cooking delicious food and I love playing retro/older games. 

I am not available for contact at this time.
