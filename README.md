My name is Anna, I'm studying at the moment to become a Pentester. 
I am active on Hack The Box and TryHackMe, as well as researching OSINT and learning Digital Forensics as a hobby. 

I plan to write several articles in the future on Medium and my LinkedIn about everything I learn. 

I will list my links here at a later time :)
